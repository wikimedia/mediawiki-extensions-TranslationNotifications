DigestEmailer
=============
The DigestEmailer script need to be configured using a cron job.
For example, it can be scheduled to run on every Sunday 10AM using the
following crontab entry.

0 10 * * 7 /usr/bin/php /www/wiki/extensions/TranslationNotifications/scripts/DigestEmailer.php 2>&1 > /var/log/digestEmail.log

The script will not start sending emails immediately. It starts inserting email
jobs to the MediaWiki job queue. Depending on the configured jobqueue scheduling
the mails will be send out. You can read more about the MediaWiki Job Queue
